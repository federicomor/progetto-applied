# NOTES AND REFERENCES

-   Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) tutorial: <https://rpubs.com/pjmurphy/758265>

-   notes from the textbook "Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis" in the same directory of this folder

-   reference paper of past year project on Well-Being

-   source: <https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/v/soga/Geodata-analysis/factor-analysis/A-simple-example-of-FA/index.htmlZ>

-   according to this article (<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0095798418771807>) it is better to perform EFA only on variables we suspect to be generated by a latent factor. Thus, it is better to follow the same procedure we used for PCA

Some graphs to validate the choice made while grouping the variables

# PREPROCESSING OF DATA

```{r}
#transforming the data: Box-Cox transformation
#must be strictly positive 
transformed_data <- select_if(pisa_data,is.numeric)
transformed_data <- transformed_data+abs(min(transformed_data)) + 1e-5 #1e-5 epsilon per ottenere disuguaglianza stretta

#Box-Cox transformations
#computing lambda
#lambda <- powerTransform(transformed_data) #take long
#I have saved it in since the computation take quite long
#save(lambda,file = "lambda.Rdata")
load("lambda.Rdata") 
#If there are some changes in data I need to compute it again

#transforming data
for(i in length(lambda$lambda)){
   transformed_data[,i]<- bcPower(U=transformed_data[,i],lambda=lambda$lambda[i])
}
#standardizing the data
transformed_data <- as.data.frame(scale(transformed_data))

#add the CNT column
transformed_data["CNT"] <- pisa_data$CNT
transformed_data$X.1 <- NULL

pisa_data <- transformed_data
```

# PERFORMING EFA

Preliminary tests:

-   cortest.bartlett(): test to see if the variables in the dataframe are uncorrellated. H0: correlation matrix sigma = Identity matrix (i.e. uncorrellated variables)

-   KMO: another check on uncorrelation

-   multivariate normality to perform factor analysis with the maximum likelihood estimation method

```{r}
checking_hp <- list()
for(group in group_list){
  #(1) CORRELATION
  #KMO(select_if(pisa_data[,included_variables[[group]]],is.numeric))
  checking_hp[[group]]$correlation <- cortest.bartlett(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric))
  #(2) MULTIVARIATE NORMALITY
  checking_hp[[group]]$normality <- mvn(data = select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric), mvnTest = "hz",univariateTest = "SW")
}
```

Selecting the number of factor to select:

the following methods are useful to select the initial number of factors. The final choice should be made based on the portion of variance explained

```{r}
#eigenvalues method
for(group in group_list){
  #scree plot
  scree(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric), 
        pc=TRUE, 
        main = paste("Scree plot", group))
  #parallel analysis
  #fa.parallel(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric), 
  #            fa="fa", 
  #           main = paste("Parallel Analysis Scree Plots",group))
  #a method from psych package with many more criteria
  #nfactors(cor(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric)),
  #         title = paste("Number of factors", group))
}
```

Here we're actually performing factor analysis. We have two options to estimate the matrix L of loadings:

-   Maximum Likelihood Estimation: requires multivariate normality on X (factanal function)

-   Principal component method (principal funtion)

```{r}
#storing the number of factors (decision based on the previous plots)
nfactors <- list()
nfactors[["tec"]] <- 4
nfactors[["psi"]] <- 4 
nfactors[["clt"]] <- 3 
nfactors[["fam"]] <- 2 
nfactors[["tch"]] <- 2 
nfactors[["sch"]] <- 2 
```

```{r}
#maximum likelihoood method (actually requires normality)
fit_ML <- list()
#principal component method
fit_PC <- list()
#trying out also sparse PC
fit_sparsePC <- list()
for(group in group_list){
  #
  fit_ML[[group]] <- factanal(x = select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric), 
                factors = nfactors[[group]], 
                rotation = "promax",
                lower = 0.0057)
  #fitting the factor analysis model
  fit_PC[[group]] <- principal(r = cor(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric)),
                               nfactors = nfactors[[group]], 
                               rotate = "promax", 
                               scores = TRUE)
  #need to study how to set para parameter
  #fit_sparsePC[[group]] <- spca(x = cor(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric)),
  #                               K = nfactors[[group]],
  #                               para = ,
  #                               use.corr = TRUE)
}
```

**A note on rotation:** loading matrix (L) is unique up to rotation made through orthogonal matrices. Thus, we have can provide as an option to this functions a rotation method to ease the interpretability of the loadings. There a two kind of rotations:

-   orthogonal rotation methods: if we assume that the extracted factors are independent

    -   "varimax": optimized to reduce cross loadings and to minimize smaller loading values, making factor models clearer

    -   "quartimax": works to reduce the number of variables needed to explain a factor, making interpretation easier

    -   "equamax": compromise between varimax and quartimax

-   oblique rotation methods: if we assume that the extracted factors are not independent

    -   "promax": Promax rotation is popular for its ability to handle large datasets efficiently. The approach also tends to result in greater correlation values between factors.

    -   The direct "oblimin" rotation approach is somewhat less efficient with large datasets, but can produce a simpler factor structure.

```{r}
for(group in group_list){
  print(fit_PC[[group]]$loadings)
}
```

Visualizing the loadings:

```{r}
#Maximum-Likelihood method

#Principal Component method
for(group in group_list){
  for(i in 1:dim(fit_PC[[group]]$loadings)[2]){
    barplot(fit_PC[[group]]$loadings[,i], main = paste("factor",group,i),las=2,cex.names=0.7)
  }
}
```
