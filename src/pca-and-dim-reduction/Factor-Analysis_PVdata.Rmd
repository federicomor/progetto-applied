# NOTES AND REFERENCES

-   Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) tutorial: <https://rpubs.com/pjmurphy/758265>

-   notes from the textbook "Applied Multivariate Statistical Analysis" in the same directory of this folder

-   reference paper of past year project on Well-Being

-   source: <https://www.geo.fu-berlin.de/en/v/soga/Geodata-analysis/factor-analysis/A-simple-example-of-FA/index.htmlZ>

-   according to this article (<https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0095798418771807>) it is better to perform EFA only on variables we suspect to be generated by a latent factor. Thus, it is better to follow the same procedure we used for PCA

Some graphs to validate the choice made while grouping the variables

```{r}
#OVERALL CORRELATION OVERVIEW
ggcorr(select_if(pisa_data,is.numeric),label=TRUE,label_size = 2)

#WITHIN GROUPS
#tec
ggpairs(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["tec"]]],is.numeric),progress = FALSE)
ggcorr(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["tec"]]],is.numeric),label=TRUE,label_size = 2)
#psi
ggpairs(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["psi"]]],is.numeric), progress = FALSE)
ggcorr(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["psi"]]],is.numeric),label=TRUE,label_size = 2)
#clt
ggpairs(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["clt"]]],is.numeric), progress = FALSE)
ggcorr(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["clt"]]],is.numeric),label=TRUE,label_size = 2)
#fam
ggpairs(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["fam"]]],is.numeric), progress = FALSE)
ggcorr(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["fam"]]],is.numeric),label=TRUE,label_size = 2)
#tch
ggpairs(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["tch"]]],is.numeric), progress = FALSE)
ggcorr(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["tch"]]],is.numeric),label=TRUE,label_size = 2)
#sch
ggpairs(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["sch"]]],is.numeric), progress = FALSE)
ggcorr(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[["sch"]]],is.numeric),label=TRUE,label_size = 2)
```

# PREPROCESSING OF DATA

```{r}
#standardize the variables
pisa_data <-  as.data.frame(scale(select_if(pisa_data,is.numeric)))
```

Quick look at the data

```{r}
boxplot(select_if(pisa_data,is.numeric),las=2)
```

# PERFORMING EFA

Preliminary tests:

-   cortest.bartlett(): test to see if the variables in the dataframe are uncorrellated. H0: correlation matrix sigma = Identity matrix (i.e. uncorrellated variables)

-   KMO: another check on uncorrelation

-   multivariate normality to perform factor analysis with the maximum likelihood estimation method

```{r}
checking_hp <- list()
for(group in group_list){
  #(1) CORRELATION
  #KMO(select_if(pisa_data[,included_variables[[group]]],is.numeric))
  checking_hp[[group]]$correlation <- cortest.bartlett(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric))
  #(2) MULTIVARIATE NORMALITY
  checking_hp[[group]]$normality <- mvn(data = select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric), mvnTest = "hz",univariateTest = "SW")
}
```

Selecting the number of factor to select:

the following methods are useful to select the initial number of factors. The final choice should be made based on the portion of variance explained

```{r}
#eigenvalues method
for(group in group_list){
  #scree plot
  scree(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric), 
        pc=TRUE, 
        main = paste("Scree plot", group))
  #parallel analysis
  #fa.parallel(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric), 
  #            fa="fa", 
  #           main = paste("Parallel Analysis Scree Plots",group))
  #a method from psych package with many more criteria
  #nfactors(cor(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric)),
  #         title = paste("Number of factors", group))
}
```

Here we're actually performing factor analysis. We have two options to estimate the matrix L of loadings:

-   Maximum Likelihood Estimation: requires multivariate normality on X (factanal function)

-   Principal component method (principal funtion)

```{r}
#storing the number of factors (decision based on the previous plots)
nfactors <- list()
nfactors[["tec"]] <- 6
nfactors[["psi"]] <- 5 
nfactors[["clt"]] <- 4 
nfactors[["fam"]] <- 3 
nfactors[["tch"]] <- 4 
nfactors[["sch"]] <- 6 
```

```{r}
#TRIED methods:
#maximum likelihoood method (actually requires normality)(works badly)
# fit_ML <- list() #factanal() from library(psych)
#principal component method ()
fit_classic_PC <- list() #princomp()
fit_FA_PC <- list() #principal() from library(psych)
#trying out also sparse PC (to be studied)
#fit_sparsePC <- list()


for(group in group_list){
  #FA through ML
  #fit_ML[[group]] <- factanal(x = select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric),factors = nfactors[[group]], rotation = "promax", lower = 0.0057)
  
  #FA through PC
  fit_FA_PC[[group]] <- principal(r = cor(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric)),
                               nfactors = nfactors[[group]], 
                               rotate = "promax", 
                               scores = TRUE)
  
  #classic PCA
  fit_classic_PC[[group]] <- princomp(select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric))
}
#possible improvements: try spca() for sparse pca 
```

**A note on rotation:** loading matrix (L) is unique up to rotation made through orthogonal matrices. Thus, we have can provide as an option to this functions a rotation method to ease the interpretability of the loadings. There a two kind of rotations:

-   orthogonal rotation methods: if we assume that the extracted factors are independent

    -   "varimax": optimized to reduce cross loadings and to minimize smaller loading values, making factor models clearer

    -   "quartimax": works to reduce the number of variables needed to explain a factor, making interpretation easier

    -   "equamax": compromise between varimax and quartimax

-   oblique rotation methods: if we assume that the extracted factors are not independent

    -   "promax": Promax rotation is popular for its ability to handle large datasets efficiently. The approach also tends to result in greater correlation values between factors.

    -   The direct "oblimin" rotation approach is somewhat less efficient with large datasets, but can produce a simpler factor structure.

# LOADINGS AND VARIANCE EXPLAINED

## Factor Analysis with PC method

```{r}
for(group in group_list){
  print(fit_FA_PC[[group]]$loadings)
}
```

Visualizing the loadings:

```{r}
#Principal Component method
for(group in group_list){
  for(i in 1:dim(fit_FA_PC[[group]]$loadings)[2]){
    barplot(fit_FA_PC[[group]]$loadings[,i], main = paste("factor",group,i),las=2,cex.names=0.7)
  }
}
```

## Classic PCA

```{r}
#BUG: I'M MISSING SOMETHING
for(group in group_list){
  print(fit_classic_PC[[group]]$loadings)
}
```

```{r}
#Principal Component method
for(group in group_list){
  for(i in 1:dim(fit_classic_PC[[group]]$loadings)[2]){
    barplot(fit_classic_PC[[group]]$loadings[,i], main = paste("factor",group,i),las=2,cex.names=0.7)
  }
}
```

# COMPUTING THE SCORES

```{r}
#little utility to compute the scores from a fit of principal() and the dataframe on which the fit is computed
scores <- function(fit,data){
  return(as.data.frame(as.matrix(data)%*%fit$loadings))
}

#utiliy to name the dataframe
add_prefix <- function(prefix,x){
  return(paste(prefix,x,sep="_"))
}

FA_PC_scores <- data.frame(matrix(nrow = dim(pisa_data)[1], ncol = 0))
for(group in group_list){
  #score names
  PC_names <- as.character(1:nfactors[[group]])
  PC_names <- sapply(PC_names, add_prefix, prefix = group)
  PC_names <- sapply(PC_names, add_prefix, prefix = "PC")
  
  #computing the scores
  FA_PC_scores[,PC_names] <- scores(fit_FA_PC[[group]],select_if(pisa_data[,grouped_variables[[group]]],is.numeric))
}

#add CNT column
FA_PC_scores$CNT <- pisa_data$CNT
```
