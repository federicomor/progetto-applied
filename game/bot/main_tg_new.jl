    *Idea of the game*
    The PISA dataset that we had contained data gathered from children in mid schools. 
    In it there are lots of different answers, related to the students' contact with technology, their wellbeing and other psychological aspects, the cultural context in which they live in, the relation with their family and with the teachers, and finally the characteristics of the school they attend.

    We grouped those questions into some categories (technology, psychology, culture, familiy, teachers, school), and with our statistical analysis we were able to sort out not only in which states there were the better schools, but also which impact those categories have in the final position of the state in the ranking.

    So we setup a game, a bit similar to Risiko or Monopoli: you have to choose your character, the state to play with, and how to spend/invest your budget, like if you were the "minister of school" in that state. We will then rank your choice and build up a global scoreboard with also everyone else plays the game.

    *Instructions to play the game*
    (1) Type /start for the welcome message.
    (2) Type /state to choose the state to play with.
    (3) Type /budget to implement your strategy.
    (4) Talk with us at our poster section.
    (5) Type /results for your final ranking agains all the players!

    *Command execution*
    Each interactive command expects that you answer in the form *target value* which provides the parameter game you want to define and the value you want to assign. 
    For example "play ESP" correctly selects ESP as the state to play with, "tec 60" correctly selects to invest 60% of your budget on category technology, etc.

    Targets are: whoami, play, tec, psi, clt, fam, tch, sch.
    Values should be: a string (for the state and whoami) or a number (for the budget).
